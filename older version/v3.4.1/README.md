# Phanes

**Phanes** is a bootstrap prompt for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). In a single command it turns an empty or chaotic repository into a fully wired, opinionated, multi-agent development environment.

It is not something you install once and forget. Think of it as a living specification that you re-run. Each time you invoke `/phanes`, it surveys the project again, upgrades the existing sub-agents, fills in any missing infrastructure, and bumps a hidden run counter. The result is an agentic team that grows with your codebase instead of rotting beside it.

**The prompt is one file.** You install a single Markdown file, `phanes.md`, as your `/phanes` command. The scripts, hooks, agents, and documents it sets up are created inside your repository during the run. The scripts that do not depend on your project's language, and the agent and report prompt templates, are fetched as tested templates from this repository, pinned to the prompt's own version, and everything else is generated. If the fetch cannot happen, the run generates those as well, so an offline install is still complete.

**Run `/phanes` and `/phanesupgrade` on Opus 5 at `high` effort** (`claude --model opus --effort high`), or Fable 5 if you can afford it. Those runs build and maintain the whole setup, so they are the ones worth spending on. Afterwards, the everyday work of the team they install is designed to run on Sonnet 5, which is what keeps a Max 5x plan viable. Effort is `high` in every case. See [Which model for which run](#which-model-for-which-run) for the table.

**Modular by design.** The core stays that one file on purpose. Anything beyond bootstrapping ships as a separate [companion tool](#companion-tools). Each companion works on its own in any repository, with no Phanes install at all, and each one snaps into the structures Phanes builds the moment it lands in a Phanes-managed project.

**Which file do you need?**

| Your situation | What to use |
| --- | --- |
| A fresh project, or any project that has no Phanes yet | Use `phanes.md` and run `/phanes` for the full setup. Running it again also keeps a current install up to date. |
| A project that already carries an older Phanes (any version) | Use `PhanesUpgrade.md` and run `/phanesupgrade` (see [Upgrading an older install](#upgrading-an-older-install) below). It refreshes your `/phanes` command, then upgrades the whole Phanes structure on a dedicated branch behind an evidence-verified checklist. Your accumulated knowledge is preserved, never rewritten. |

## What it does

The first time you run `/phanes` in a repository, the prompt walks Claude Code through a strict setup in several phases.

**1. Pre-flight.** Before anything else, the run checks itself. It fetches this repository's `phanes.md` and compares version stamps. If a newer version has shipped, it asks whether you want to upgrade: accept and it stops and routes you to `/phanesupgrade`, decline and it proceeds on the installed version.

It then installs the four MCP servers it benefits from:

- `context7` for live library documentation, fetched on demand.
- `deepwiki` for digest answers about external GitHub dependencies, so agents never pull dependency source into their context.
- `semble` for hybrid code search, so an agent finds the exact snippet it needs instead of sweeping a whole module with grep and reading entire files.
- `serena` for symbol-level code navigation, installed on the first run. It runs through `uv`, which the pre-flight also installs if it is missing.

These servers are enhancements, not hard dependencies. If one fails to install, the run records a TODO and continues in a degraded mode. There are exactly four on purpose: every MCP tool schema costs context in every session, so each server has to earn its place by removing more context than its schema costs. Every generated agent carries a usage rubric saying when each server saves tokens and when to make no MCP call at all.

The pre-flight detects your platform (bash on POSIX, PowerShell on Windows), then runs a capability census of what you already have installed, probing each MCP server for actual reachability and authentication rather than mere configuration. On a first run it asks you once, as a single checklist, which of those capabilities Phanes may build policy around; the choice is saved, and later runs ask only about changes. Phanes only ever builds a mandate around a capability you selected and the census found reachable, and nothing you installed is ever changed or removed. It also ensures the official `frontend-design` skill is present (skills cost no context until invoked). Finally, each run keeps a progress ledger at `.phanes/run-progress`, so a session that dies or compacts mid-bootstrap resumes from the last completed phase.

**2. Repository comprehension.** Phanes reads the README, the source tree, the configs, and the CI to work out the project's real purpose, its primary language, its build system, and its module boundaries. Directories that are not part of the core product, such as vendored dependencies, example packs, and demo content, are filtered out.

**3. Project memory infrastructure.** Phanes scaffolds the substrate that every sub-agent works against:

- `documentation/` holds session summaries, plans, dated architecture snapshots, and a curated API registry. That registry captures the things code search cannot see, such as deprecations, contracts beyond the type signatures, and anti-patterns. The generated API surface itself lives outside the tree as a machine baseline in `.phanes/registry/`. Every folder carries a **generated `_index.md`**, so agents find knowledge by descending indexes, which costs a few hundred tokens, instead of scanning the whole tree. Files respect a soft ceiling of 500 lines and are split into an indexed folder when they outgrow it.
- `tests/` holds `unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/`, `fixtures/`, and `helpers/`, with a verbatim README and the same `phanes new-file` header-stamp discipline that `src/` uses.
- `.phanes/scripts/` is a script library that owns every mechanical rule, from creating files with header stamps and checking line counts to auditing the documentation ceiling (`doc-check`), regenerating indexes (`doc-index`), measuring the root files that load every session against their character budget (`register-check`), regenerating the API baseline, diffing the API, and listing modules. The scripts that do not depend on your language are installed from tested templates fetched from this repository (pinned to the running version), and each one finds the project by walking up to `.phanes/config.json` and uses only paths relative to that root, so a hook can never be wired to the wrong tree.
- **v3.4 adds ten more commands, on Windows**, which mechanize the parts of the run that were previously done by hand. `preflight` gathers a whole pre-flight (install marker, versions, MCP servers, platform, installed capabilities) into one digest instead of thirty to fifty separate tool calls; `update-preflight` measures what has changed since the last run so a re-run can verify instead of regenerate; `install-templates`, `scaffold` and `manifest-write` do the fetching, tree-building and provenance recording; `ledger` and `census-diff` handle run state and capability drift; `hook-ledger-status` is the session-start read of that ledger, silent unless a previous run died mid-flight; and `repo-manifest` and `batch-apply` give agents a source inventory and a way to apply many edits in one call rather than one call per edit. **Every one of them observes or writes what it is told to and decides nothing**: `preflight` reports that an install looks like a legacy one, the session still decides what to do about it. On POSIX these ten are refused by name rather than faked, and the manual flow they replace is unchanged, so nothing is lost there.
- `.claude/settings.json` holds the hooks that enforce mechanical rules at the harness layer. A blocking PreToolUse guard denies creation of any unstamped new file, and an advisory PostToolUse check runs size and documentation audits on every write. Prompts forget under context pressure. Hooks cannot.
- `.phanes/config.json` records the confirmed module list, language, build system, and hook preferences.

**4. Tiered workflow definition.** Every task is sorted into one of three tiers: T1 for a single-file quick fix, T2 for a feature inside one module, and T3 for anything that cuts across modules. Each tier loads a different amount of context and engages a different chain of agents, but review is universal. Even a T1 fix gets a lightweight Critic pass on its diff. Only the depth of the review and the weight of the documentation scale with the tier. If a task outgrows its tier mid-flight, the agent must stop and ask the orchestrator to promote it.

**5. Sub-agent roster generation.** Phanes writes 6 to 10 deeply scoped, expert personas to `.claude/agents/*.md`. Each one is assigned a model by a dated rubric that is re-validated on every update run:

- **Architect/Designer**, the sole writer of the curated registry and the architecture snapshots.
- **close-verifier**, the independent close-time verifier and sole writer of the generated API baseline in `.phanes/registry/`. After every structural change it re-derives the baseline, re-runs the build check itself rather than trusting the coder's report, and confirms that what was applied matches what was approved. It stays a separate agent from the Architect on purpose, since a verifier that also authored the work is not an independent check.
- **Critic agents**, which produce numbered, ID-tagged audit reports.
- **Patch-Author**, which turns the approved plan into sequenced patch files but never applies them.
- **Executor**, which applies approved diffs only and uses `phanes new-file` for every new file.
- **Synthesizer/Arbiter**, which consolidates parallel perspectives into one unified plan.
- Plus Analyzer, Planner, Validator, Optimizer, Integrator, Monitor, and Cleaner variants tuned to your specific stack.
- **Scouts** are not part of the roster. Specialists spawn them on the fly as read-only subagents that fetch and digest bulky one-time context such as module surveys, test logs, and registry sweeps. A strict cost guard makes sure every spawn pays for itself in the specialist context it preserves.

**6. Workflow codification.** The YAML files in `.claude/workflows/` are the single source of truth for how agents chain together. Every chain ends the same way: the Synthesizer runs for parallel work only, then the Critic, then `close-verifier` on T2 and T3 changes, then the primary agent. Because of that ordering, the artifact that gets applied is always the one that was audited. Phanes also updates `CLAUDE.md`, at the project root and at module roots only, so the primary agent knows how to triage, delegate, navigate the documentation by index, and review.

Visualized, that chain looks like this. Where the work enters depends on its shape: a single task is triaged and run directly, while a multi-step plan is handed to an ephemeral **Orchestrator** that walks the plan in small batches. A task's tier changes only how deep the review goes and how much documentation it produces, never whether the review happens:

        * Synthesizer runs for parallel work only. Because the chain always
          ends review-then-apply, the artifact applied is always the one audited.
       ** Orchestrated runs only. The receipt is all that crosses back into your
          main session, which is why a long plan can run for hours without the
          session filling up and compacting. Single tasks and short plans skip
          the Orchestrator entirely and return straight to you.
      *** The opening batch size is a guess made before any design exists. Once
          the first step is actually designed, the planner knows better and says
          so, and the batch grows or shrinks within the 1 to 3 band.
     **** Grouped batches, which is what a batch is for. The steps in a batch run
          as ONE chain, not one chain each, so three steps cost one review pass
          instead of three and the context is loaded once instead of three times.
          Steps that touch the same files are the best candidates, not the worst.
          A batch splits back into per-step chains for one reason only: a step
          needs an earlier step's result already written to disk before it can
          even be written. Nothing is skipped: the Critic still returns its two
          verdicts per step, the Executor still applies in plan order and names
          the exact failing step, and anything ambiguous stays grouped.
```

**This is the shape Phanes is built for.** The setup pays off most when you write a plan first, broken into numbered steps and grouped into phases, and then let the run work through it. Give each step a clear boundary and each phase a clear exit condition, hand the plan to Phanes, and the Orchestrator will size its own batches, route every step to the right tier, and keep the review chain intact from the first step to the last. A vague single sentence still works, it simply gives the machinery much less to hold onto.

**7. Bootstrap session summary.** Phanes writes `documentation/session-summaries/SS00001_phanes-bootstrap_<date>.md`, which records the install, the confirmed module list, the agent roster, and any TODOs that were deferred.

> **After the first run, restart your Claude Code session.** Hook configuration is snapshotted when a session starts, so the enforcement hooks arm on the next session. Phanes reminds you of this verbatim at the end of the run.

When you run `/phanes` again, it detects the existing install through the `.claude/.phanes` marker and refreshes in place. Agents, workflows, scripts, hooks, and READMEs are all measured against the latest `phanes.md` and refreshed wherever they have drifted. If a newer Phanes has been published, the run stops first and asks whether you want to upgrade; accept and it routes you to `/phanesupgrade` (see [Upgrading an older install](#upgrading-an-older-install)), decline and the run proceeds on the installed version.

---

## Which model for which run

Two different questions get confused with each other. **Which model you launch the session on** changes per run. **Which model each generated agent runs on** is decided by Phanes itself and is not your dial. This section is about the first one.

| The run | Recommended model | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Install, the first `/phanes` in a project** | **Opus 5**, or **Fable 5** if you can afford it | `high` |
| **Update, re-running `/phanes`** | **Opus 5**, or **Fable 5** if you can afford it | `high` |
| **Upgrade or patching, `/phanesupgrade`** | **Opus 5**, or **Fable 5** if you can afford it | `high` |
| **Everyday workflow execution, once the team is installed** | **Sonnet 5**, which is what makes Max 5x workable, or **Opus 5** if you can afford it. **Fable 5 for pre-planning only** | `high` |

```bash
claude --model opus   --effort high     # installing, updating, or upgrading
claude --model sonnet --effort high     # everyday work with the installed team
```

**Why the bootstrap runs hot.** `/phanes` and `/phanesupgrade` are single-shot, judgment-dense runs. They survey a whole repository, decide module boundaries, author an entire agent roster, and in the upgrade case perform file surgery on accumulated project knowledge that cannot be re-earned if it is lost. You pay for that run once and live inside its output for weeks, so a weaker model costs far more downstream than it saves at the time. Opus 5 is the recommendation. Fable 5 is better still and priced accordingly.

**Why everyday work does not.** Workflow execution is a repeated cost, paid every day, multiplied by every agent in every chain. Sonnet 5 at `high` is what the roster is designed around and it is what makes the Max 5x plan a real option rather than a technicality. Opus 5 across the board is a genuine upgrade if your budget is not the binding constraint.

**Where Fable 5 earns its price in daily use: pre-planning, and only pre-planning.** Writing the plan is the highest-leverage thinking in the whole cycle, it happens once per plan, and every downstream agent inherits its quality. Drafting `plan.md` on Fable 5 and then executing it on Sonnet 5 is a good trade. Running an entire execution session on Fable 5 is not.

**Effort is `high` for all four rows, and it is not a dial.** Reasoning effort is fixed once at session launch and governs the primary session and every sub-agent it spawns. From v3.4 there is one level and every roster agent runs at it. `xhigh` is retired. Set it at launch rather than mid-run: changing it mid-session writes to your global settings and leaks into other projects and parallel sessions.

---

## How to use

### First run

Type `/phanes` in your project. It scans the repository and builds the whole agentic team and documentation structure around it. Three things make the first run land well.

- **Start the session on Opus 5 at `high` reasoning effort.** Launch with `claude --model opus --effort high` (or export `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL=high` before starting). Fable 5 is better still if you can afford it. The first run is the one that decides your module boundaries and authors your whole agent roster, and you live inside that output for weeks, so it is the run worth spending on. See [Which model for which run](#which-model-for-which-run) for the full table. `xhigh` is retired; there is no hotter setting to reach for. Set effort at launch rather than mid-run: changing it mid-session writes to your global settings and leaks into other projects and parallel sessions.
- **Give it something to read, ideally a plan.** On an empty or brand-new repository, create at least a `plan.md` that describes what you want to build. Phanes reads it to understand the project's purpose and shapes the entire setup, including the agents, the workflows, and the module layout, around the project you actually intend to build rather than around an empty folder. **Best results come from a plan written as numbered steps grouped into phases**, each step with a clear boundary and each phase with a clear exit condition. That is the shape the run is designed to consume, and it is what lets the Orchestrator batch the work cleanly once execution starts (see the [diagram above](#what-it-does)).
- **Steer it if you like.** Anything you type right after the command is treated as a directive and takes priority over the defaults, so you can inject your own needs into the setup. For example: `/phanes focus on the api/ module; skip pre-commit hook install`.

When the run finishes, restart your Claude Code session so the enforcement hooks arm. Phanes reminds you to.

### Re-running `/phanes`: when, and how often

Think of `/phanes` as refreshing Claude's knowledge of your project. Every run surveys the codebase again and brings the agent team, the workflows, and the registries back in line with reality. **Launch an update run on Opus 5 too**, for the same reason the first run wants it: it is deciding what your team looks like, not using it.

**From v3.4 a re-run measures before it rebuilds** (Windows). It opens by asking what has actually moved since the last run: the installed spec version, the capability census, the hook table, the register, file hashes, and the git history since the last recorded run. If nothing moved and your worktree is clean, the run verifies rather than regenerates, which makes a habitual re-run cheap enough to be habitual. If something did move, only the artifacts that change implicates are rebuilt, and the run tells you which sensor triggered each one. Where it cannot see (no git repository, or no recorded previous run) it does the full pass exactly as before, because not knowing is not the same as nothing having changed.

- **Early, small project: run it freely.** Several times a day is fine. While the codebase is small a run costs little in tokens and context, and keeping the agent team current pays off constantly.
- **Before an implementation plan.** This is a good habit rather than a hard rule, and it is the highest-value run of them all. Write your plan first, say for a new module, as numbered steps grouped into phases, then run `/phanes` and inject it. Injecting simply means pasting the plan's contents, or its path, right after the command. Phanes updates the agents and workflows, and creates new ones where needed, so the team is tuned to execute exactly that plan when you start. Then hand the same plan to the run that executes it and let it work through the steps in order.
- **Session bookends.** Running it at the end of a workday, or first thing when you sit down, keeps the project context fresh before real work begins.
- **Grown project: throttle down.** Once the codebase is large, once or twice a day is plenty. Add a run right before a large plan. Smaller ones usually do not need one.

## Core principles enforced by Phanes

- **Procedure in scripts, judgment in prompts, and hooks at the harness layer.** Any rule a script can enforce, such as line-count limits, header stamps, registry edits, API diffs, and documentation ceilings, lives in `.phanes/scripts/`. The hooks in settings.json make the critical ones impossible to skip: a blocking stamp guard, an advisory size check, and from v3.4 on Windows a session-start check that tells you when a previous run died mid-flight. That third one prints nothing at all in the normal case, which is the point; you hear from it only when there is something to hear. Mechanical rules written into prompts get forgotten under context pressure. Scripts do not forget, and hooks cannot be skipped.
- **Single writer per artifact.** Every registry file, snapshot, and summary has exactly one writing agent, and so does every generated `_index.md`, whose sole writer is `phanes doc-index`. Many readers, one writer.
- **No direct code changes by sub-agents, at any tier.** A coding agent emits a report that contains a proposed diff, a Critic reviews it, and the Executor applies it. The depth of the review scales with the tier, but the review itself is never skipped. The primary Claude Code agent does not edit code directly either. It orchestrates. Every Critic review closes with two mandatory verdicts, one for spec compliance and one for quality, and a report that is missing either verdict is returned unread.
- **No UI approval by prose.** A UI proposal has to declare its target viewports and reference designs up front. After the change is applied, a designated visual verifier captures before and after screenshots and runs an explicit pass or fail checklist. "Looks good" is not evidence. When the capture tooling is missing or broken, the failure is diagnosed, remembered for later sessions, and the result is marked as visually unverified rather than passed silently.
- **Context injection over context inheritance.** A sub-agent receives only the slice of context that its tier allows, and it pulls bulky material through read-only scout digests instead of loading it raw. Pollution from a sibling task is structurally impossible.
- **Bounded fan-out.** No more than 5 sub-agents run at once, whatever the harness would allow. A genuinely wider sweep is handed to the harness's own large-scale orchestration by recommending it to you, never by an orchestrator quietly multiplying its own fan-out. Every session summary records the run's fan-out ledger.
- **Compaction survival.** Long sessions compact, and a summarized mandate is a forgotten mandate. A run keeps a phase-by-phase progress ledger on disk and resumes from it after a mid-flight death. A run that can no longer see the spec's exact text re-reads it from disk instead of executing a lossy summary of itself.
- **Index-first documentation navigation.** No agent ever bulk-reads `documentation/`. It descends the indexes, loads the target, and reads nothing else.

## For inexperienced users: step-by-step from zero

Never used Claude before? This takes you from no account at all to a running Phanes install. Experienced Claude Code users can skip straight to [How to install](#how-to-install) below.

### Step 1: Create a Claude account

Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and sign up with an email or a Google account.

### Step 2: Get a plan that can carry Phanes

Phanes is a multi-agent system. A single task can run chains of several Claude instances, such as a planner, a coder, a critic, an executor, and a monitor, and each of them uses part of your allowance. **The Pro plan is not enough**, since its limits run out after a few chains. You need one of these:

- **Claude Max 5x**, the workable entry point for lighter projects.
- **Claude Max 20x**, recommended, with comfortable headroom for real multi-agent work. Subscribe under Settings, then Plan, at claude.ai.
- **Claude API, pay per token.** Create an account at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) and add credits. Be aware that multi-agent orchestration uses far more tokens than ordinary chat, and the cost scales with how hard you drive it.

Check current pricing on the official pages, since plans and limits change.

### Step 3: Install Claude Code

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

If you already use Node.js 18 or newer, you can instead run `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`. Make sure `git` is installed too ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)), because Phanes requires it.

Verify the install with:

```
claude --version
```

### Step 4: Sign in

Open a terminal in any project folder, run `claude`, and follow the login prompt, or type `/login`. Choose **Claude account** if you subscribed to Max, or **Anthropic Console** if you are paying per token through the API.

### Step 5: Install Phanes

Continue with [How to install](#how-to-install) directly below. It is two commands.

---

## How to install

Phanes is a single Markdown file, `phanes.md`, so installing it just means putting it where Claude Code can run it as a slash command.

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), installed and authenticated.
- `git`, plus whichever language toolchain your project actually uses.
- On **Windows, PowerShell** (5.1 or newer, which ships with Windows). The Phase 0 pre-flight runs its install commands through PowerShell there. POSIX systems use any standard shell.
- Optional but strongly recommended: `uv`, which runs both the `serena` and `semble` MCP servers. The Phase 0 pre-flight installs it for you if it is missing.

### Install as a user-level slash command (recommended)

This makes `/phanes` available in every repository you open.

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aloim/phanes/main/phanes.md \
  -o ~/.claude/commands/phanes.md
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\commands" | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aloim/phanes/main/phanes.md `
  -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\commands\phanes.md"
```

### Install per project (alternative)

If you only want Phanes inside one repository and want it tracked in version control:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aloim/phanes/main/phanes.md \
  -o .claude/commands/phanes.md
```

### Run it

Open the target repository in Claude Code, then type:

```
/phanes
```

Anything you add after the command is forwarded through `$ARGUMENTS` and takes priority over the default plan, so you can steer the run:

```
/phanes focus on the api/ module; skip pre-commit hook install
```

The first run takes several minutes. It pauses to confirm a few choices, such as module boundaries and hook install, and ends by asking you to restart the session so the enforcement hooks arm. Later runs are faster, since only the differences are written.

### What gets created on the first run

The default `.gitignore` shipped with this repository excludes `.claude/`, `.phanes/`, and other runtime artifacts. Adjust it to taste in your own project.

## Upgrading an older install

If a project already carries an older Phanes installation (any version), install the upgrader alongside `/phanes`:

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aloim/phanes/main/PhanesUpgrade.md \
  -o ~/.claude/commands/phanesupgrade.md
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aloim/phanes/main/PhanesUpgrade.md `
  -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\commands\phanesupgrade.md"
```

**Run the upgrade on Opus 5 at `high` effort**, or Fable 5 if you can afford it (see [Which model for which run](#which-model-for-which-run)). An upgrade performs file surgery on knowledge your project cannot re-earn if it is lost, which makes it the worst run in this library to economize on.

Then open the project and run `/phanesupgrade`. It refreshes your `/phanes` command, detects the installed version, plans the jump from the changelog, and computes exactly what to archive, generate, and regenerate from the installed-artifact manifest. Everything runs on a dedicated `phanes-upgrade-<date>` branch behind an evidence-verified checklist. Your accumulated knowledge is preserved byte for byte, superseded artifacts are archived rather than deleted, and you review and merge the branch yourself. The only precondition is a clean `git status`.

You normally get here from `/phanes` itself: whenever a newer Phanes has shipped, the version check at the start of every run offers the upgrade and routes you here.

---

## Companion tools

Phanes is built to stay modular. Rather than growing the core file, capabilities beyond bootstrapping ship as **companion tools**. Every companion is a full standalone tool that works on its own, in any repository, with no Phanes install. Each one is also built to cooperate with the structures Phanes generates, so together they form one ecosystem.

- **[Charon](https://github.com/Aloim/charon)** finds dead code, unused files, unused dependencies, and duplicated code, then writes an evidence-backed audit report without touching anything. Standalone `/charon` command for any repository; in a Phanes-managed project the report is filed into the documentation tree, open items land in the session summary, and dead exported APIs are proposed as registry annotations. Worth running before large refactors, since stale code is context poison for agents.
- **[Philia](https://github.com/Aloim/philia)** shares a Windows terminal in the browser for collaborative or remote vibecoding: a password-protected public link, shared terminal tabs, and a side chat, tunneled from your own PC with nothing for guests to install. Share a Phanes-managed project and everyone drives the same agent team together, while the host keeps a kill switch and a live indicator.
- **[Mosyn](https://github.com/Aloim/mosyn)** gives Claude Code agents a shared, disciplined project memory on decentralized storage (Walrus and SEAL): recall before acting, decision and failure logging, and schema-locked session distillation with an append-only audit trail. Alongside Phanes it hands the whole agent team one durable memory across sessions, machines, and teammates.
- **[Metis](https://github.com/Aloim/metis)** reads Claude Code's own run transcripts and reports whether your agent team actually used the tools and workflows it was told to, harvesting the short-lived subagent transcripts before the harness discards them. Standalone `/metis` command; in a Phanes-managed project the capability census detects it, and update runs have it verify past suggestions and file an adherence report the run acts on.

---

## Recommended third-party enhancements

Phanes never installs these. The capability census discovers them only if you installed them yourself, and the matching rubric wires them into exactly the agents whose duties they serve, under least privilege and never as a hard dependency. All were verified as actively maintained on 2026-07-15, so re-check before adopting one. Code search is absent because Phanes installs `semble` itself; a rival code-index server is granted only where it beats `semble` for your stack, and then in its place, since one job should carry one schema tax.

- **Shell-output compressors** (for example RTK) run as a PreToolUse proxy that strips noise from build, test, and git output before it reaches any agent's context, while preserving errors and diffs in full. In measurements from July 2026 this removed about 89 percent of the noise on average. It helps every agent that runs shell commands and needs no Phanes wiring at all.
- **Usage monitors** (for example claude-hud and claude-monitor) show live context fill and rate-limit forecasting alongside long multi-agent runs. They are purely observational and cost no tokens, which makes them useful company for any Phanes bootstrap on a subscription plan.
- **CLAUDE.md linters** (for example cclint) validate the instruction files Phanes generates on the CI side, catching things like deprecated model identifiers, broken imports, and leaked keys.

## Version

Current: **v3.4.1** (2026-08-23). A patch about when an observation should create no further work. A field report from a downstream project measured three consecutive plan steps and found agent dispatches going 8, 13, 17, Critic passes 1, 3, 4, and review prose reaching four lines per line of code, with the plan's scope estimate missed by 9.5x and the same "still owed" list copied verbatim into every session summary. The reviewers were catching real bugs; the roles that run on Opus (architect, Critic, security auditor, Orchestrator) simply had no threshold below which a finding stays a note. v3.4.1 adds five: acceptance criteria are tests or structural checks, never token counts over the tree; the Reflect loop is capped at two passes, after which a fresh producer rewrites the file whole instead of patching a patch; security findings are graded and only CRIT, HIGH and MED create work, with LOW and INFO staying in the report and the auditor closing on an explicit "no further findings" line; the Critic and auditor write their reports to `reports/reviews/` (resolving a contradiction between §IV and the Critic grant that had forced every verdict into the session summary) and the batch session summary is capped at verdicts and pointers, about 150 lines, with a carry-over rule so open items are scheduled or dropped rather than copied a third time; and a design that comes back at four times the plan's stated scope halts the step for re-planning instead of being recorded and absorbed. Chain composition, review presence, the two mandatory verdicts, the security pass cardinality and the receipt schema are untouched. The report and the diagnosis against v3.4.0 are kept in the internal project records.

Beneath it: **v3.4.0** (2026-08-05). A release about doing less work per run. Phanes has always told a session to enumerate, fetch, install, verify and record, and doing that by hand costs thirty to fifty tool calls of pure procedure and produces a slightly different result every time. **Ten new commands do that work instead** (Windows this cycle), and the update run stops regenerating everything and starts measuring what actually moved: same version, same capabilities, same hooks, clean worktree, nothing new in git since the last run means the run verifies rather than rebuilds. Where it cannot see, it does the full pass, because not knowing is not the same as nothing having changed. Also new: a **session-start check** that tells you when a previous run died mid-flight, silent in every other case; **`repo-manifest`**, a source inventory agents consult before sweeping the repository with grep; **`batch-apply`**, which applies many edits in one call with a saved pre-image rather than git as its undo; and **stale-customization detection**, which tells you when a file you customized was a workaround for something since fixed upstream, without ever overwriting your edit. Motivated by a real project found sitting on two files customized around five defects that had been fixed upstream the next day, with the safety mechanism dutifully protecting it from every fix since. **The mechanized bootstrap is Windows-only in v3.4** and the POSIX manual flow is unchanged, so no POSIX project loses anything; the ten commands are refused by name there rather than faked. This release also **absorbs v3.3.2**, which was completed and never published, so everything below is folded in and attributed since v3.3.1. The full accounting is in [`Changelog.md`](Changelog.md).

Folded in from **v3.3.2** (completed 2026-07-28, never released): a bug-fix pass and three spec changes, both prompted by a bug report from a downstream project against v3.3.1. Four confirmed Windows script bugs are fixed: `doc-index.ps1` no longer crashes on a documentation folder past 100 files (a case-insensitive local variable was shadowing the script's own ceiling constant at the point the oversized slice is read), DOC-header reads are UTF-8 explicit so non-ASCII text stops mojibaking, every generated file writes UTF-8 without a byte-order mark, and `doc-check` no longer undercounts files with many blank lines past the 500-line ceiling. The POSIX index script now rotates newest-first like Windows instead of by filename. A new optional `doc_discipline` config block (`index_exclusions`, `frozen_classes`) lets a project mark documentation subtrees excluded from indexing or exempt from the ceiling check. **Two breaking changes:** `phanes new-file` now refuses an unknown module name, and refuses a `docs` target that resolves outside `docRoot`, the fix for a genuine defect the report called A6 (the script alone never honored the long-standing `docRoot` key that `doc-index` and `doc-check` have read since v2.6, so a docs target silently landed at the repository root); see [`PhanesUpgrade.md`](PhanesUpgrade.md) for the upgrade path. On the spec side, batching becomes **grouped, full stop**, sized by step scope rather than tier and composed for cohesion, with one combined security pass covering the whole batch diff whenever any step in it touches security; a spawned producer may now make a small in-scope edit on its own judgment and report it afterward instead of asking first; and the model and effort roster **flattens** to a single fixed level, Sonnet 5 at `high` for every agent except the plan-authoring chain and the security-review specialization, which run Opus 5 at `high`. `xhigh` and the per-agent effort-delivery bridge it required are retired; the removed machinery is preserved verbatim in the attic document [`documentation/specs/2026-07-28_retired-effort-bridge.md`](documentation/specs/2026-07-28_retired-effort-bridge.md) in case it is ever needed again. Three of the report's eight numbered findings (not four, A6 above was a real defect) were feature requests for config keys Phanes had never defined rather than bugs; the full, finding-by-finding accounting is in [`Changelog.md`](Changelog.md).

Further beneath: **v3.3.1** (2026-07-27) finished the batching work v3.3 started. v3.3 gave the Orchestrator a dial for how many plan steps a batch covers and left a second one missing: whether those steps run one chain each or one chain between them. **Grouped batch execution** added it. Where every step in a batch was small (T1 or T2), none touched security, and none edited a file another one edited, the batch ran as a single chain, one producer turn, one review, one apply, instead of paying the same three turns over for each step. Three small steps stopped costing six or twelve agent turns and cost two or four instead. Nothing was skipped to get there: the Critic returned its two verdicts **per step** so no step lost its review, the Executor applied step by step so a failure still named exactly which one broke, and rework re-reviewed only the steps that actually failed. The v3.3.2 work folded in above replaces the gate with grouping by default; per-step is now the exception rather than the rule.

Further beneath: **v3.3** (2026-07-26) made four corrections to the orchestration economics: batch renegotiation (the architect that plans a batch's first step resizes the batch to match true scale, adopted by default), agent persistence (worker agents resumed rather than respawned, saving a measured entry tax of roughly 80,000 tokens per avoided respawn), bounded Critic self-fix for trivia, and relative effort (recommended launch **Opus 5 at `medium`**, agents authored as rungs against that dial, the Orchestrator free to lift one a rung where a step earned it). The v3.3.2 work folded in above retires that relative scheme entirely in favor of one fixed level. v3.2.1 aligned the Model & Effort rubric with **Claude Opus 5** and added the session-effort recommendation and the Orchestrator branch in the workflow diagram; v3.2 added the top-anchored, delete-protected **Pinned Directives block** as the first content of every project's root `CLAUDE.md`, a **procedure-precedence rule** with a supersession-annotation pass, and the ephemeral **Orchestrator** that executes long plan runs in self-sized batches so the primary session stays slim enough to run across many phases without compacting; v3.1 gave Phanes its real upgrade path, routing version jumps to `/phanesupgrade` (plan from the changelog, exact file operations from an installed-artifact manifest, on a branch you merge yourself) and prefixing agents with the project slug; v3.0.1 corrected the reasoning-effort rubric and added the CLI-spawn bridge for per-agent effort; v3.0 added the capability consent layer, the `close-verifier` rename, and the cross-shell `cli.js` launcher. The full release history is in [`Changelog.md`](Changelog.md), and every superseded version is archived verbatim in [`older version/`](older%20version/).
