# Usage: phanes new-file <module> <path> "<description of at least five words>"
# <module> may be a source module, tests, or docs. docs targets get the DOC DISCIPLINE header and
# trigger a doc-index regeneration; source and tests targets get the module stamp in the project's
# comment syntax (read from .phanes/config.json). Refuses a missing or too-short description.
